<div id="image-info"><h1 class="about">Awareness Poster</h1>
	
        <p>This was a child abuse awareness poster created for my print portfolio class. Because we were meant to have two target audiences, I had this one target children, so the message gives a phone number for children to be able to seek help for any abuse they may suffer from.</p></div>   </div>

<div id="image-info"><h1 class="about">Packaging Label</h1>
		
        <p>Originally designed and used on small soap boxes, these labels were made for a packaging project where we would pick a certain type of products and create the label/packaging. I created boxes/labels for soap and went with something minimal yet colourful.</p></div>
