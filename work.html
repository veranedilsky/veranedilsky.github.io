<div id="image-info"><h1 class="about">Awareness Poster</h1>
	
        <p>This was a child abuse awareness poster created for my print portfolio class. Because we were meant to have two target audiences, I had this one target children, so the message gives a phone number for children to be able to seek help for any abuse they may suffer from.</p>
